###Introduction
Adds capability to automatically resize attachment images (.jpg, .png, .gif, or .bmp) to fit within the bounds specified.  The image format will be maintained unless it is unable to fit the resized image within the max allowed file size specified.  In this case, if the optional change format is enabled, the system will convert the image to JPEG for better compression.

 - The ability to set a max width and height for attached images, images are resized proportionately
 - The ability to allow converting image formats only if its required to maintain the file within the specified max file size

There are admin settings available with this mod, go to forum -> attachments and avatars -> attachment settings -> find resize attachment section on the page
